The Coordination Unit updates all group calendars and creates meeting folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system. Committee Members are advised <TIMEX3 tid="t2" type="DURATION" value="P1W">a week</TIMEX3> before each meeting to read all related documents. The Committee Members hold their meeting, and the Support Office then produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member. Within 5 working days, the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes, which are then sent to all Committee Members. The Support Officer then updates all departmental records.
