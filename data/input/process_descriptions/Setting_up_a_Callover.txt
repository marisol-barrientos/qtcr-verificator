In a small claims tribunal, callovers occur once a month, to set down the matter for the
upcoming trials. The process for setting up a callover starts three weeks prior to the callover
day, with the preparation of the callover list containing information such as contact details of
the involved parties and estimated hearing date. One week prior to the callover, the involved
parties are contacted to determine if they are all ready to go to trial. If this is the case, the
callover is set, otherwise it is deferred to the next available slot. Finally, on the callover day,
the callover material is prepared and the callover is held.
