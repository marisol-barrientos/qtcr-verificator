The ISP sends an invoice by email to the customer on the first working day of each month
(Day 1). On Day 8, the customer has the full outstanding amount automatically debited
from their bank account. If an automatic transaction fails for any reason, the customer
is notified on Day 9. On Day 10, the transaction that failed on Day 8 is re-attempted. If
it fails again, on Day 11 a late fee is charged to the customer's bank account. At this
stage, the automatic payment is no longer attempted. On Day 15, the Internet service is
suspended until payment is received.
